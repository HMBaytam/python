# Learning Python

I want to embark on a mission to become well versed in the language of Python. The only, and best, way to do this is by challenging myself to write code on a daily basis!

I have a general understanding of the basics of code so getting a hold of the basics won't be difficult, but I have never been able to call myself a developer because I never mastered any programming language.

#### This will all change now!

I have come up with a few goals I want to achieve by the end of this exercise. They seem pretty simple now but I will be updating them as I go along. I tried to abide by the S.M.A.R.T principle while creating those goals so that everything seems achievable.

## Goals

- [x] Get a greater understanding of _Python_ basics
- [ ] Learn **Object Oriented Programming** in _Python_
- [ ] Learn _Django_
- [ ] Learn how to use databases (i.e postgreSQL) in a python application
- [ ] Create Web Applications using everything I've learned

## Resources

- [Learn Python the hard way](https://learnpythonthehardway.org/python3/ 'Learn Python the hard way')
- [A Complete Beginner's Guide to Django](https://simpleisbetterthancomplex.com/series/beginners-guide/1.11/ "A Complete Beginner's Guide to Django")

By the end of all this I want to be comfortable enough with Python so that I can go to step 2 of my **_MASTER PLAN_**
