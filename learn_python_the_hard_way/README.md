# **Learn Python 3 the Hard Way**

So this book claims that if you follow each word and type in each piece of code (**_no copy pasting_**) you will be well versed with tha basics.

After one finishes the book, they can open any other Python book and pick it up easily.

## **What I learned**

Ok so the book is awesome (**_in my opinion_**) because it helps you not only understand what you're typing but also engraves it in your brain. The author took **DIY** to a whole different level.

Whether it was the basics like _strings_ _integers_ or _lists_ and _dictionaries_. The author doesn't just spoon feed you the information, rather he gives you the tip of the rope and lets you figure the rest out for yourself.

### **OOP!**

Now I thought that this will be the hardest topic for me to understand, **_it actually was_**, but the way the author simplified it and broke it down help me grasp the complex concept of OOP. Now by no means am I an expert in this, but I do have the basic understanding of this so that I can tackle more advanced books about this topic

### **modules**

One weird thing about python is the term _module_. I mean it looks like a script, **but it isn't**, and it acts like a library, **but again it isn't (well somewhat)**. Now I have to admit I am a bit confused about this but at least I know how to import and use a python module in any projects I will create in the future.
