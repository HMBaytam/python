# Learn Python the Hard Way

So this book claims that if you follow each word and type in each piece of code (**_no copy pasting_**) you will be well versed with tha basics.

After one finishes the book, they can open any other Python book and pick it up easily.

## What I learned

Ok so the book is awesome (**_in my opinion_**) because it helps you not only understand what you're typing but also engraves it in your brain. The author took **DIY** to a whole different level.

Whether it was the basics like _strings_ _integers_ or _lists_ and _dictionaries_. The author doesn't just spoon feed you the information, rather he gives you the tip of the rope and lets you figure the rest out for yourself.
